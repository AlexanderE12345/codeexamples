If you have a Raspberry Pi, there are [installation instructions](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-on-a-raspberry-pi-4-in-minutes) available.  

### Tutorials

- Tutorial from [visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)

### Extensions

- I recommend installing the following extensions:
  - C/C++
  - markdownlint (if you want to use VS Code to edit markdown documents - here is a nice [markdown tutorial](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))
  - Remote - WSL (if you are using Ubuntu under Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  - Vim if you like to use the Vim navigation commands

## gVim

[Download Link](https://www.vim.org/download.php)

I mostly use gVim in Windows for editing C & C++ code.  There is a steep learning curve, however once you learn the basics you can install Vim plugins in other editors, including Visual Studio Code & Eclipse.

There are a lot of links to tutorials on the [Vi page](../linux/vi) in this repository.
