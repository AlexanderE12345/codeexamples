## Examples

- A great collection of data structures & algorithms from the *Grokking Algorithms* book implemented in several languages is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms)

## Algorithm Analysis

- [How to analyze time complexity: Count your Steps](https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/time-complexity-explained/)
- [Algorithm Anlysis](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/algorithms/Algorithm_Analysis.html) is an in depth introduction to algorithm analysis

### Big-Oh Notation

- [A Beginner's Guide to Big-Oh Notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
- [Big-Oh: How Code Slows as Data Grows](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/slowsgrows.html) has examples in Python, but a good overview
- [Complexity and Big-O Notation](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vernon/cs367/notes/3.COMPLEXITY.html)

## Advanced Practice Problems

The problems listed here are *well* beyond what I will expect you to do in this class, but you should have the ability by the end of the course to complete them.  They make great practice for coding interviews.

- [The Great Tree-List Recursion Problem](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/109/TreeListRecursion.html) is a challenging practice problem that uses trees & doubly linked lists.

## Interesting links

- [The Case for Learned Index Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01208) describes a method for using artificial intelligence techniques to learn a more efficient index.
