# Introduction to C++

These videos give you an overview of C++, specifically with writing classes.  The first video is a simple "Hello, World" example.  The next two are examples of writing classes.  There is some intentional redundancy between the videos to reinforce important concepts.

## hello.cpp

[Video](https://youtu.be/SpGArm0iCz4) (3:00) - *Hello, World example*

Example of string type & output in C++.

## class.cpp

[Video](https://youtu.be/1ou-Jrlua7g) (9:40)

This file has an example of a class with 2 private attributes and 2 public methods.  An example of a constructor with default parameters is included.  Note that the methods are defined *outside* the class definition.

## staffmember.cpp

[Video](https://youtu.be/vqPb1pIff8M) (9:23)

Another example of writing a C++ class.  Includes examples of an initializer list and declaring object variables & object pointers.  We will extend this class in a later module as an inheritance & polymorphism example.

## animal.cpp

[Video](https://youtu.be/CDa1CPXONg4) (7:25)

Another example of writing a C++ class.  We will extend this class in the next module as an example of inheritance & polymorphism.
